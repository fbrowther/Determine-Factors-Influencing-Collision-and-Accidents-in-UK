# Project-2

This is an ETL project where a dataset is sourced, transformed (cleaned) and loaded onto either relational (PostgreSQL) or non-relational database (MongoDB) depending on the use case and the relationship of the data one is working on. 

After loading, the stored database can then be accessed/queried to analyse, derive insights in order to solve the initial business use case successfully. 

### ETL
The ETL process of Extraction, Transformation and Loading; hence forms an integral part of the entire data pipeline.
