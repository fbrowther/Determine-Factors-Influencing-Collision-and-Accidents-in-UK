# Project-2
This is an ETL project where depending on the use case, a data is sourced, transformed (cleaned) and loaded onto either relational (PostgreSQL) or non-relational database (MongoDB). The stored database can then be accessed/queried to analyse, derive insights and reported to solve an initial use case successfully. 
The ETL process of Extraction, Transformation and Loading; hence forms an essential part of the entire data pipeline.
